\begin{abstract}
    Participatory democracy advances in virtually all governments. South America presents a prominent context with mixed culture and social predisposition. At 2012, civil, academic and governmental parties started elaborating the ``Common Vocabulary of Social Participation'' (\vcps\ from the Brazilian name \emph{Vocabul\'ario Comum de Participa\c{c}\~ao Social}), as a public and online process. By May, 2013, first reference documents were publicized, together with a preliminary \owl\ code,
logos, and a diagram of a general ``public consultation''.
The Corais Platform kept online records of the process, like discussions and preparation of texts. 
This article exposes this material and proposes elementary unfolding, highlighting the ``Social Participation Ontology'' (\ops\ from the Brazilian name \emph{Ontologia de Participa\c{c}\~ao Social}). To exhibit this new ontology, this steps were considered: completion of \vcps\ \owl\ code for preliminary \ops, with necessary translations and corrections; correction of ontological contradictions and enhancements of class names and labels in Portuguese, Spanish and English; a toy expansion of the ontology by further specifying classes; use cases of \ops\ by researchers and public managers; and use examples regarding knowledge organization and a \sparql\ endpoint. Ongoing work involves incorporation by the official Brazilian social participation federal portal, incorporation by civil participative organizations, linkage to other participative ontologies. \ops\ is being used as an upper ontology, and all classes linked to \foaf\ and \bfo\ as higher upper ontologies.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:into}
Easy access to social media is reshaping citizen participation in government affairs~\cite{socMed}. 
Information and communication technologies (\ict s) have exhibited such an impact on the way individuals interact
 that it is giving birth to new organizational methods in social movements. These changes can be observed, for example, in the 2010 Arab Spring and the 2013 Brazilian protests. These events gathered millions of people and, although recent, have shown direct and strong impact in governments and new laws, and the forecast is an intensification of the process~\cite{digRev1,digRev2,digRev3}.

Concomitantly, electronic government initiatives are flourishing. Favored mainly by the ubiquity of Internet technologies (e.g. \html\ 5, \node, open source browsers) and by the need for renewal of representative democracy practices. 
These initiatives have taken place in various platforms, including usual social networks (e.g. \facebook, \twitter)
 and dedicated clients created by both government and civil society agents~\cite{socMed,pita2010arquitetura,barros2010alem,knowledge}.

A natural challenge arises: how to link all information produced into an unified knowledge base. This is being addressed, at the technology level, by semantic web developments. Endorsed by World Wide Web Consortium (\wwwc), current semantic web technologies include~\cite{Sem1}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reasoning by means of ontological specifications,
    \item linking data from different sources (e.g. databases),
    \item organization of domain knowledge for coherent consideration.
\end{itemize}

Key among these technologies, ontologies are considered one of the pillars of the Semantic Web. An ontology is a formal specification of a shared conceptualization~\cite{gruber}.
They are used in the semantic web mainly to give meaning to data, useful for datasets available on the web to make them automatically retrievable and linkable with other datasets. The \wwwc\ created the Web Ontology Language (\owl) as a standard to represent ontologies in the web.
The second version of the language is called \owl\ 2 and offers greater expressive power~\cite{owl2}.

In this context, to describe and give meaning to social participation, the ``Common Vocabulary of Social Participation'' (\vcps\ from the Brazilian name \emph{Vocabul\'ario Comum de Participa\c{c}\~ao Social}) was proposed as a joint effort of Latin America academic, civil and governmental groups~\cite{corais}. Although started in 2012, a recent initiative for ontological developments, it already yielded relevant material, including a public preliminary \owl\ ontology with a concise taxonomy. Also important are the reference documents reporting results from a first working phase, from July to December, 2012. 
As stated by the community, \vcps\ was propelled by three goals: 1) to ease adoption of the vocabulary; 2) to stimulate the creation of public tools to understand, visualize and summarize how participation is happening; 3) to meet the need of participative initiatives to open and link their data. 

It is important to notice that \vcps, an ontology, was called a \emph{vocabulary} both to ease understanding of the general public and because it started as a vocabulary. The present article presents the ``Ontology of Social Participation'' (\ops\ from the Brazilian name \emph{Ontologia de Participa\c{c}\~ao Social}), based on \vcps, in which the term \emph{vocabulary} was substituted by the term \emph{ontology} for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The usage of the word ``vocabulary'' can lead to confusion is some situations as \ops\ is an \owl\ ontology (not, for example, a \skos\ vocabulary).
    \item Documentation seems inconsistent when an ontology is repeatedly called a vocabulary.
    \item \ops\ is, in fact, an ontology, with a vocabulary, a taxonomic organization and properties further relating the terms.
    \item This coherent naming is a prerequisite for for academic acceptance and further formal adoption by government instances, such as the Brazilian Federal Portal of Open Data~\cite{dadosGov} and of Social Participation~\cite{participabr}.
\end{itemize}

Also, The term \emph{common} was dropped when \ops\ was conceived, as the term is redundant for an ontology. The \vcps\ presented other difficulties, such as missing classes, incorrect URI specifications (containing spaces), some logical flaws, and unnecessary out-of-standards restrictions. This were all solved within \ops\ (to the extent authors were able to, of course).

Next section is dedicated to an inspection of the documents delivered by the \vcps: reference textual documents, images, OWL code, blog posts, discussions and \etherpad s. Section~\ref{exp} presents \ops: modifications made from \vcps\ to \ops: class and property names and labels, class restrictions and property axioms. Section~\ref{ospUtil} is dedicated to \ops\ usage: derreferatiation, \sparql\ queries, a toy \ops\ expansion, discursive example of usage, and use cases from government, civil society and academic parties. Concluding remarks are stated with future work, in Section~\ref{conc}. 

\section{Related work: CVSP}
From April to December, 2012, the ``Common \emph{Vocabulary} of Social Participation'' (CVSP) was first conceived. In the registered online process, 66 users interacted, 6 of them were the most active~\cite{metodologia}. Various materials were produced both as activity traces and as reference media. This section is dedicated to these materials.

\subsection{Reference textual documents}\label{refDocs}
The main documents are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Commented methodology''~\cite{metodologia}: this document describes the public process of ontology conception. It is composed by brief inspections of forum topics, pointing both pertinent characteristics of the online collective process and ontological observations (about classes and properties). Considerations are made about tightening relations to the Open Government Partnership, an international initiative to foster transparency and open practices in governments worldwide~\cite{OGP}, and the Brazilian formal action plan, as means to achieve ontology usage. 
     There is also a proposal of a systematic study about electronic government initiatives, so that the CVSP might be better contextualized. This document ends by proposing an agenda of meetings with academics, entrepreneurs and government parties.
    \item ``Conceptual modeling, version 0.1 (in natural language)''~\cite{conceptualMod}: this document is a description, in ordinary English, of the CVSP ontology. The introduction is mainly a collage of the document above~\cite{metodologia}. Both the itemized description of the ontology, and the considerations for its usage, are of great value as reference. Figure~\ref{fig:v1}, shows a diagram representation of the ontology, which is also associated with this document and is further described in the next section.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Images}
There are various images associated with the ontology, most notably in~\footnote{http://corais.org/vocabulariodaparticipacao/node/1517}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Various proposals for the OSP logo, some of which are in figure~\ref{logo}.
    \item Figure~\ref{fig:v1} shows an English and completed version of the original diagram of CVSP in the document~\cite{conceptualMod}.
    \item A diagram for general public consultations. An OWL implementation of this model is envisioned for near future, as described in Section~\ref{public}. Figure~\ref{fig:consult} has the diagram itself.
\end{itemize}

It can be seen that these logos were conceived for the ontology when it was called a \emph{vocabulary}. Community documents reflect this nomenclature, which is being changed with this article and subsequent work.}

\subsection{OWL code of CVSP}\label{owl}

The OWL code for the CVSP is online~\cite{owlVcps}. 
% Estou voando nas alturas
The CVSP OWL code did not contain all relation from Figure~\ref{fig:v1}. This is directly addressed in Section~\ref{exp}, which exposes the implementation of all relations in the OSP, including CVSP OWL corrections and adjustments to best practices. The complete and correct OSP ontology is then expanded in Section~\ref{downwards}.
A diagram representation OSP taxonomy is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:vcpsCC}, while the ontology diagram is at Figure~\ref{fig:v1}.

\subsection{Blog Posts}
The CVSP blog~\cite{coraisBlog}
aggregates both important discussions and documents in no more than twenty posts to date.
All OWL code, final documents, public consultations, mental map and images are posted in the blog~\cite{coraisBlog}. 
The first post was in July 24, 2012. Last post to date is from May 7, 2013.
Most blog posts are from the first day (almost half of them). They received more than
twenty commentaries. Two ``out-of-season'' blog posts, one in August 9, 2012 and another in October  22, 2012, separate first day posts from last posts. Both have about ten commentaries.
Last blog posts occurred as a few days burst and a final message, a month after.

There are three more recent blog posts, from November and December, 2013. But these already address OPS conception from CVSP.

\subsection{Discussions and etherpads}
There are numerous commentaries in the blog posts, in which collective elaboration was registered. Besides that, four etherpads 
were written (these are interfaces that allows writting online texts with multiple simulteneous contributors~\cite{etherpads}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item A pad for important words.
    \item A pad dedicated to a second phase of the common vocabulary elaboration, which did not happen yet.
    \item A pad for process documentation. It became the first document described in Section~\ref{refDocs}. 
    \item A pad for both vocabulary specification and ``questions not addressed to in the webinar''.
\end{itemize}



\section{OSP: the Ontology of Social Participation}\label{exp}
%A próxima secao já é a conclusão. Alem dessa sessão ter ficado grande, voce precisa uma sessão onde demonstra que essa ontologia é util para alguma coisa

\begin{figure*}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figs/opsBFO___}
    \caption{Diagram representation of the Ontology of Social Participation (OSP). Arrows with white heads indicates ``is a'' relations (subclass points to superclass). Arrows with black heads indicates property relations from subject to object . All property relation yield existential restrictions, with the exception of the ``has characteristic'' property, that does not yield restriction.}
    \label{fig:v1}
\end{figure*}

 
Followng the exposition in Section~\ref{sec:into}, from the CVSP the OSP was conceived. This section makes four considerations about OSP: first is label standardization and an exhibition of implemented and unimplemented CVSP classes, properties and restrictions. Features present in Figure~\ref{fig:v1}, but not present in the community release, are fully implemented in Section~\ref{impl}. Elementary further specification of subclasses is addressed in Section~\ref{downwards}. Examples of usage are addressed in Section~\ref{examplesUsage}. 

For completeness of exposition and deference to CVSP community efforts, consideration of upper ontologies is at Section~\ref{upper} and the public consultation model depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:consult} is considered at Section~\ref{public}. 

\subsection{Standardization and exhibition of implemented features}\label{impl}
Without explicit criteria, CVSP IRI was \url{http://lumii.lv/ontologies/Corais.owl}. OPS IRI was chosen to be \url{http://purl.org/socialparticipation/ops} for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item This IRI is directly related to the ontology name (OPS).
    \item This IRI, also an URL, is independent from government and other political parties. This is important to coalesce with interested parties: the Brazilian Federal Social Participation Portal\cite{participa}, Brazilian government repository of vocabularies and ontologies~\cite{vocab}, civil society and NGOs.
    \item The IRI, when reached via HTTP, can be redirected to where current documentation is held.
\end{itemize}

Labels in the languages of interest should be written in label fields. Even so, class names can be friendly to (potential) users, bearing the attention not to take the class name as the label or as a meaning restriction.

For standardization, all classes were written in CamelCase and without accents. Class names were written in English to ease internationalization, adoption and maturation. Labels were written in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Therefore, class names changed, receiving respective labels and a plain textual short explanation.
Table~\ref{ospClasses} exhibits all classes is OSP.

\begin{table*}

OSP Properties fit headlessCamelCase format, are readable in English (to ease internationalization, adoption and maturation), and have well defined domains and ranges. Table~\ref{ospProps} is dedicated to OSP properties, with labels in English, Portuguese and Spanish.

\end{table*}

All restrictions in OSP are existential and all properties yield restrictions, except hasParticipationCharacteristic. Table~\ref{ospRestr} is dedicated to OSP restrictions.

Problem      & generatesCause     & Cause\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{ospRestr}
\end{table}

It is important to realize that OSP is dedicated to a complete social participation process, with a beginning, middle and end.
Thus, such OWL restrictions are valid for the final state of the process (for example, in an arbitrary snapshot, a \texttt{SocialActor} may be not tied to a role). This might lead to NULL or ``not yet defined'' field supplies.

A comparison of the CVSP OWL code~\cite{owlCCPtg} 
with the diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:v1}, which reflects official CVSP documentation, revealed that a class, two properties and three restrictions were not implemented. These were fully implemented in OPS. These are the missing classes, properties and restrictions missing in CVSP and that were implemented in OSP:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Class: ParticipationCharacteristic.
    \item Property: hasRole.
    \item Property: composesSolution.
    \item Restriction: Role hasParticipationCharacteristic some ParticipationCharacteristic.
    \item Restriction: Results composesSolution some Solution.
    \item Restriction: Problem generatesCause some Cause.
\end{itemize}

Also, in CVSP, existential restrictions were  written as ``min 1''. 
These were changed to the standard ``some'' existential restriction.

OSP is available online~\cite{owlOSP}. To ease navigation of the ontology by interested parties, it is also available in the Webprotege interface~\cite{owlOSPwp}. The diagram of OSP taxonomic structure is exposed in Figure~\ref{fig:owlCC}.

Examples of upper ontologies usage with OSP is under development and should be available in a dedicated work, as possibilities should be inspected carefully. Pertinent to OSP, but not upper ontologies, are FOAF~\cite{foaf} (for describing people and things they do) and Dublin Core~\cite{dublin} (for describing resources, with special attention to digital resources).

\subsection{OSP growth}\label{downwards}

    \caption{A taxonomic diagram of an expanded instance of OSP. Darker orange marks defined classes: PaidExecutor is defined as being the subject of a \texttt{receivesFrom} relation with a \texttt{SocialActor}; \texttt{DownloadedMob} is defined by being the subject of a \texttt{convoquedBy} relation with a \texttt{SocialNetwork}. OWL code is online for live editing~\cite{owlExp}. The new classes added to OSP are in Table~\ref{ospFooClass}}
    \label{fig:owlExp}
\end{figure*}

To this point, OSP is complete (no missing classes, properties and restrictions with respect to documentation), correct (no spaces in URIs and \texttt{min 1} restrictions specified as existential restrictions), and names of classes and properties standardized (English in CamelCase and headlessCamelCase). This way, OSP matches, with coherence, CVSP community online documentation~\cite{corais}. As no greater consensus was reached, further developments of OPA should wait feedback and unroll of community processes.

As an example of possible aditional classes, another instance of the ontology is uploaded to Webprotege, from which some newly created classes and properties are exhibited~\cite{owlExp}. Table~\ref{ospFooClass} is dedicated to these aditional classes while Figure~\ref{fig:owlExp} exhibits the resulting taxonomic structure.

The property \texttt{receivesFrom} was also added and has an inverse: \texttt{SocialActor ``paysTo'' Executor}. Also, the \texttt{DownloadedMod} class is a defined class by the restricton: \texttt{Mob convoquedBy Network}, with a newly defined property \texttt{convoquedBy}.

This is one of the numerous ways by which OSP might deal with further classes, properties and restrictions. This particular expansion was chosen as an example by plain observance of community documentation and recent social affairs, such as the Brazilian protests.

%\subsubsection{SparQL examples of usage}

\section{OSP utility}\label{ospUtil}
OSP is meant to be useful. First, as a sistematization of what is social participation to Latin America groups, as conceived by CVSP. Second, as a mean to ease linked data, and enable integration of various instances for social participation. An indicative of this pertinence is OPA, an ontology that already uses OSP.



\subsection{Usage of OSP via a SparQL endpoint}
Accessing multiple databases is one of the OWL ontology basic purposes. The standard way to acess these data via ontologies is by using a SparQL endpoint. This endpoint delivers data from a triplestore or, with more experimental technology, relational database systems, such as a MySQL server (e.g. via OnTop/Quest~\cite{onTop}). Either way, the query is the same, i.e. the user or machine reaching the endpoint uses the same protocol in order to retrieve information through semantic criteria. Figure~\ref{endpoint} is a schematic representation of OBDA (Ontology Based Database Access), which is a common name for this multiple database access through ontologies.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{figs/endpoint}
    \caption{Scheme of the common use of ontologies for multiple databases integration. A user or application reaches a SparQL endpoint. This endpoint, throught ontologies, delivers data from one or more databases. Nowadays, the most usual is to find only one database available in an endpoint, and this database is usually duplicated and not synchronized, but available as a (converted) triplestore. Even so, it is possible to access multiple ontologies and it is desirable that the databases have synchronous access, i.e. without need to convert data to triples beforehand.}
    \label{endpoint}
\end{figure}

Some examples of this usage can be given by SparQL queries and concise explanations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{"select ?s ?s2 ?s3 where \{?s a ops:SocialActor . ?s2 a ops:Person . ?s3 a ops:Organization\}"}: this query retrieves all social actors (\texttt{?s}), be each a person or an organization, all persons (\texttt{?s2}) and all organizations (\texttt{?s3}). In a similar manner, one can retrieve all roles played, all executers, all initiators and all supporters.
    \item \texttt{"select ?s ?o where \{?s ops:startsCause ?o\}"}: this query retrieves all causes started and their initiators.
    \item \texttt{"select ?s ?s2 ?o ?o2 where \{ ?s a ops:Action . ?s ops:belongsToField ?o . ?s2 ops:executesAction ?s . ?s ops:producesResults ?o2\}"}: this query retrieves all actions (\texttt{?s}) along their Action Field (\texttt{?o}), their Executer (\texttt{?s2}) and their Results (\texttt{?o2}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discursive examples of usage}\label{examplesUsage}

OSP usage might not be obvious at first. How is data being linked? How is field knowledge being organized? Core principles of this utility, reflecting the exposition in Section~\ref{sec:into}, can be understood by the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Different participation instances have social actors, actions being developed, organizations involved, problems being tackled, etc. These can yield one consistent database by means of OSP usage.
    \item One can understand the mutually exclusive nature of being a paid or a voluntary contributor by observing the expanded version of OSP, exposed above. Also, noticing the fact that a mob can be very big or not, and that it can be convoqued or not by a Network, can make the field more neat for a newcommer or ease discussions and problematizations for senior researchers or politicians.
\end{itemize}

Imagined examples are useful to make these points clear:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suppose a public SparQL endpoint unifies several participation instances by means of OSP. Thus, the number of participants (Social Actors) is publicly available. Also, depending on the platforms, one can observe how many are individuals, how many are organizations, and understand to which extent the corporative influence is explicit. One can observe how many of the participants are the same in each platform, and what roles they take, and make conclusions about how much society is really participating or if these processes are manipulated by the same agents. One can also gaze uppon the problems being discussed and which solutions are being proposed, therefore easing the sense of what is being considered important and valid as public discussions. This list of possibilities is endless, specially when OSP variations and expansions are considered.
    \item Suppose a person, say Jessica, has a new proposal for a participative system that uses OSP. She can have a quite concise understanding of the concepts involved, and how they relate, by means of OSP. She can now make very objective observations and deliver clear suggestions that relate directly to the system being used. She can even make an OSP variation or another ontology, as a way to confront the schemes.
    \item Supose there is an automatic system for exhibiting indicators about social participation (how effective it has been, how wide the scope of interests, etc). Instances that are integrated by OSP are queried for information and, for example, this system registers any organization involved as a social actor. In the case of the expanded OSP exposed above, for example, the system registers any mob, whose incidence was recorded in the database as a \texttt{DownloadedMob}, as related to some social network, be the network known or not.
\end{itemize}


\section{Concluding remarks and future work}\label{conc}
OSP, based in CVSP, % Essa aqui? Mesmo que voce decida usar o mesmo nome para as duas, vai ter que fazer algo OSP 1 e OSP 2 para separar as duas de forma a não haver mais confusão.
yields initial steps in achieving an effective social participation ontology: community has registered activities and delivered reference documents, including the OWL ontology presented in this article. If on one hand such an ontology is difficult to be obtained in short term, on the other hand this is a precedent in which deeper observations can take place.

Sections~\ref{ospUtil},~\ref{downwards},~\ref{upper} and~\ref{public} have expansion directions for the ontology, regarding uses, further definition of classes, upper ontologies and related ontologic structures.

On the practical side, the use of this ontology or related developments for the Brazilian federal participation portal (\url{Participa.br}~\cite{participa}) is a desirable possibility, as it implies usage and good maintenance. The parties responsible for such portal and for Brazilian government vocabularies and ontologies have already taken a step towards this development, with direct contact with authors and the publication of OSP in a government instance~\cite{pubVocab}. Moreover, an ontology was done for \url{Participa.br}, based in the OSP~\cite{opa}. This is confluent with the presidential Decree that establish a policy and commitment for social participation\cite{decree}. In this context, presidential and ministerial parties have come close, to start formalizing current legal participatory mechanisms (e.g. conferences, forums, roundtables) in ontological terms.
Hosting of ontologies on Webprotege~\cite{webprotege} have become central, as a way to share specific ontologies and collects commentaries.

\subsection{Further work}
Further works involves observing community manifestations about OSP and this article, accomplishing use by means of formal instances and civil society, studying upper ontologies usage with OSP and creating new ontologies for each Brazilian formal social participation instances (e.g. ombudsman office, roundtables, councils, foruns, conferences). The use of OSP (or a variant) in different instances is envisioned for creating indicatives of social participation and easing participation processes, which should be better studied.

Future work involves careful consideration of Basic Formal Ontology to enhance linking participation data to scientific research. 
Also, further detailing subclasses might be carefully modeled for different instances, with respective interested parties.

\appendix

\section{Upper and domain ontologies}\label{upper}
There are various ontologies of interest for participatory democracy. To exemplify, three upper ontologies were chosen:
\begin{itemize}
    \item BFO $\rightarrow$ the Basic Formal Ontology is oriented to scientific use of data, which is confluent with Brazilian hackers and scientific community~\cite{bfo}. 
    \item DBpedia $\rightarrow$ ``a crowd-sourced community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia''. Convenient for bootstrapping the OPS to out-of-domain knowledge with crowd-sourced structured information~\cite{dbpedia}.
    \item W3C recommendations for open-government, these are the work product of specialized groups and are regarded in high account by the semantic web community~\cite{egovW3C}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Public consultation}\label{public}
Public consultations have core importance in participatory democracy and the model in figure~\ref{fig:consult} was conceived as part of OSP community documentation.
Therefore, an OWL implementation of such public consultation, should be developed and made public, with dedicated attention.
Considerations of this public consultation with respect to the OSP and formal existent instances should be addressed as well.
This public consultation model is observed here for completeness of exposition and further details goes beyond the scope of this article.
